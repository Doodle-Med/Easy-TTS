    <h1>Terms of Service for Easy Text-to-Speech Playground</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: [Current Date]</strong></p> <p>
        Welcome to the Easy Text-to-Speech Playground ("App"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the App, accessible at easytexttospeech.netlify.app. By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Use of the App</h2>
    <p>
        The App is provided as a tool to interact with the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API. It is intended primarily for personal, non-commercial use and experimentation. You agree to use the App in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as Google's Cloud Platform Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy, as the App makes calls to Google APIs under your authenticated account.
    </p>

    <h2>2. User Authentication and Google Cloud Usage</h2>
    <p>
        The App uses Google Sign-In (OAuth 2.0) to authenticate you and authorize calls to the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API. All API calls made by the App occur under your own Google Account and Google Cloud project context. You are solely responsible for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Maintaining the security of your Google Account.</li>
        <li>Any costs incurred for Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API usage associated with your account resulting from the use of this App.</li>
        <li>Ensuring the text you provide for synthesis complies with Google's policies and does not contain illegal, harmful, or sensitive personal information for which you do not have consent to process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
        The App interface and its original content (excluding Google Cloud voices and API functionality) are the property of the developer. The generated audio is subject to Google's terms regarding Text-to-Speech output.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
        The App is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or meet your specific requirements. Functionality depends on the availability and behavior of Google Cloud APIs, which may change without notice.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the developer shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the App; (b) any conduct or content of any third party (including Google) related to the App; or (c) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>
        We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
        These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
