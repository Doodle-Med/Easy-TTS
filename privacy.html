    <h1>Privacy Policy for Easy Text-to-Speech Playground</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: [Current Date]</strong></p> <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how the Easy Text-to-Speech Playground ("App," "we," "us," or "our"), accessible at easytexttospeech.netlify.app, handles your information when you use the App. This App is a client-side tool designed for personal use.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Process</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Google Account Information:</strong> When you authenticate using Google Sign-In, we receive a temporary access token from Google to authorize API calls on your behalf. We access basic profile information (like your email address, used for identifying the developer in Google's consent screen prompts) as part of the standard OAuth flow managed by Google. We do not store your Google password or long-term credentials. Authentication is handled securely by Google.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Text Input:</strong> Any text you enter into the App's text area is processed directly in your browser and sent to the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API for the sole purpose of generating audio. This text is not stored by our App on any server.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Synthesis Configuration:</strong> Your selected voice, pitch, rate, and chunking preferences are used only within your browser session to configure the API calls to Google Cloud Text-to-Speech. These settings might be temporarily stored in your browser but are not transmitted elsewhere except as parameters to the Google API.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Generated Audio Data:</strong> The audio data generated by the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API is sent back to your browser for playback and download. This audio data is stored temporarily in your browser's memory or as a Blob object and is not stored by our App on any server.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Browser Storage:</strong> The App may use your browser's Local Storage to save preferences like theme choice (light/dark) or debug log settings if you enable them. This data remains solely within your browser.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Usage Data (Hosting Provider):</strong> Our hosting provider, Netlify, may collect standard web server logs and analytics data (like IP address, browser type, pages visited) for operational purposes. Please refer to Netlify's privacy policy for details.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To authenticate your session using Google Sign-In and authorize Google Cloud API calls under your account.</li>
        <li>To send your text input and configuration parameters to the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API to generate audio.</li>
        <li>To enable playback and download of the generated audio within your browser.</li>
        <li>To store your UI preferences (like theme) in your browser's local storage.</li>
        <li>To provide debugging information locally in your browser if enabled.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Google Cloud Platform:</strong> We share your text input and configuration parameters with the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API as necessary to provide the App's functionality. Your use of the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API is subject to Google's own Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>No Other Third Parties:</strong> We do not share your personal information, text input, or generated audio with any other third parties.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        This App operates primarily within your browser. We utilize HTTPS for secure communication with Google APIs. Authentication is handled by Google's secure OAuth 2.0 flow. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your own Google Account. Data stored in your browser's local storage is subject to your browser's security mechanisms.
    </p>

    <h2>User Rights</h2>
    <p>
        You can clear data stored by this App in your browser's local storage through your browser settings. You can manage the permissions granted to this App via your Google Account settings at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>This App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>
